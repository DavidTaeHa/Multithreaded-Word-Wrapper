Using opendir()
and readdir(),
we can easily
obtain a list
of all files in
a particular
directory. One
could imagine
making this
recursive by
making your
code recursive:
when reading
some directory
A, you
encounter a
subdirectory B,
handle it and
its descendents
in a recursive
call, and then
continue
reading
directory A.
Unfortunately,
there is a
limit to how
many files and
directories a
processes can
have open at
once, which
would limit the
depth of the
directory
subtree our
program could
handle.
Instead, ww
will use a work
queue. Each
time a
subdirectory is
found, its path
will be added
to the
directory work
queue. Once the
directory is
finished (and
closed), the
directory
traversal
function will
obtain the next
path from the
work queue, and
begin reading
its entries.
Thus, the
number of
directories
open at a time
is fixed,
regardless of
the depth of
the directory
tree.

Note Each file
thread is a loop
that will handle
multiple files. We
do not start a new
thread for each
file. The use of a
single work queue
tends to balance the
amount of work done
by each thread. If a
thread is working on
a particularly long
file, other threads
will automatically
obtain new files and
redistribute the
work load.

Part III (25 points)
Concurrent wrapping
with concurrent
directory traversal.
When the first
argument to ww is
-rM,N, where M and N
are positive
integers, ww will
wrap all files in
the specified
directory and its
descendent
directories using M
threads to read
directory files and
N threads to wrap
regular files. While
it is not required,
it would be
reasonable to use a
common
implementation for
all three parts,
such that -r is
treated as -r1,1 and
-rN is treated as
-r1,N.

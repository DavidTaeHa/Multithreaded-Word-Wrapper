The main thread will start one or more work threads that will perform the actual word-wrapping tasks. Again, we will use a work queue to distribute the load. Each time the directory traversal system
encounters a regular file, it adds that file’s path to the file work queue. Each wrapping thread will repeatedly obtain a file path from the file work queue and wrap that file’s output to the
corresponding output file. If the work file queue is empty, and the directory traversal is complete, the file thread should terminate.
